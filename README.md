# Fiction

Yet another lisp in JavaScript.

Reader takes text values and converts them into a objects representing 
s-expressions.

Expander deals with macros, and mostly works.

Interpreter runs s-exprs directly and returns a weird value object.

Compiler takes s-exprs and attempts to produce valid JS code. It mostly 
works too.
