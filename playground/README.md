# Playground

Sort of a test setup, but not really. This is just for visually checking things 
that should work do work as intended, there's no checking that particular values
are emitted or things that should fail do fail.

Most of this code will be turned into real tests later when I know more what I'm 
doing. Yes, I know this isn't the "proper" way of doing things.
